      <p className='info'>I currently have been working with the Start Up incubator at 1876 ventures and am in process potentially getting funding to build
        the first iteration of these tracking devices. I have made promises to the people that have been working with me to not share 
        any intellectual property that I have created at this time. If you have any questions I would be happy to give a technical run down in person.
        I can also answer any questions about these tracking devices or basic information if you reach out me! My email is in the footer.
